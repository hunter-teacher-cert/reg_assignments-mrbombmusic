This task involves students creating a picture using shapes made with p5 functions (circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, lines). They need to include at least one area in the picture (either a circle or rectangle) which, when clicked by the mouse, will trigger some type of change in their picture, either static or animated. This task requires students to know basic shape functions, variables, different types of conditional statements (nested and compound)
Steps:
- Create picture with shapes
- Add colors
- Create code for mouse click event
- Create conditional for shape clicked
- Create code to be executed when shape is clicked

Just as preface to the search results that students might come across for this task, I do provide code examples for what is needed for this assignment as well as my own example of what a finished project would look like. My thoughts are that a student who would look to google for answers for this would be one who was really not paying attention when we went over it during class to the point where they missed me explaining that there is reference material for this project OR a student who might really be struggling for ideas on what to do. Otherwise, students might just google for random things that I cannot really predict what there search terms might be.<br>

### Google search: p5js shape clicked
- [link 1](https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-interactivity-1.html)<br>
This result goes to an example on the p5.js website examples page. It could be useful as it does include the code needed to click a circle and have it do something. It is pretty straight forward for the task students would be doing, although it has the circle change to a random color, meaning it uses the random function which is not something we would have covered at this point. The code is copypastable. Since it is just a code example, I don't really feel like it would provide much context for a student to learn from. I think they might just copy there code into their own sketch but would get errors based on different variable names or curly brackets. it also includes the same code we would have covered in class and I have provided a reference sheet already.<br>

This result goes to a page from the Introduction to Computation Media curriculum. The specific lesson is titled "Rectangles and Clicks: How can I use mouse clicks in p5.js". There are multiple examples on this page. In theory, it could be useful, but in regards to my 7th grade students, I do not think a student who would be googling for answers would make much of an effort to read what is on this page. They would probably just take some of the code from the examples. However, the page also shows the visual output from the code it provides so that would help students be able to see what the code was doing.<br>

- [link 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/p5js/comments/i2oguj/clicking_on_custom_shapes/)<br>
This result goes to a reddit thread which is someone asking about clicking on custom shapes with multiple vertices (which would not be relevant for this project). The poster provides an example of a quiz game where you click states on a map. There are only a few replies to this thread, one provides link to a sketch which is also not really helpful for the student task and another mentions a p5 library called clickable.js, but there is no link and upon googling it, it doesn't really provide any helpful material and I would assume students would look elsewhere if they even got to this point.<br>

### Goole Search: p5js mouse click shapes
- [link 1](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseClicked)<br>
This result goes to the p5 reference page for the built in mouseClicked function. It does provide an example of code and some documentation about this function. It is straight forward and presented in a clear and simple way. However, for this project, I would have taught students to use the built in boolean variable **mouseIsPressed** to be used in a conditional statement, so this function would not appear familiar to them and I don't think most of them would understand how to use it within the context of this project.<br>

- [link 2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/p5-js-mouseclicked-function/)<br>
This result goes to a geeksforgeeks.org entry, also about the built in mouseClicked function with two different code examples. There is very little explanation to go with the code examples. From what is written in the code examples, I could see a student thinking that this was something relevant to what we are trying to do, but as I said for the previous result, this is for the mouseClicked function which was not something that we would have covered for this task, so I don't think students would be able to make this code work within the context of their own project. Also, along with the code examples, there were screen shots provided for the output of the code examples, but since the output is meant to be interactive for the user, having static screen shots that don't actually do anything when you click them seems to be pointless and even counterproductive for what they are trying to each about on this page.<br>

This result goes to a page for a p5 library called "p5.recognize" The only description provided is *p5.recognize.js is a p5.js library that detects mouse click events on primitive p5 shapes and returns a string indicating the name of the shape* Other than that, the page just opens up to the index.html file for the p5 sketch. While there is the sketch.js file for the example code, you would need to know to click on it and I'm not sure a student looking for answers online would know that and they would probably be confused by the html code and go search somewhere else.
