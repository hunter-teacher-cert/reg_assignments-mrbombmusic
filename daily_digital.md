### Major Point:

- Company has developed robotic window washer to clean windows on high rises and sky scrapers.
- Includes following technology:
    - Force sensors to ensure it does not break glass
    - Stability monitor so it is not affected by wind
    -  Machine Learning to "recalculate optimal cleaning path hundreds of times per minute"
- Article frames window washing as "dirty and dangerous" and a job that "makes sense to automate"

### Why I selected this story:
While this does make sense in regards to a job that could be automated, it made me think about how this would make the profession of window washer obsolete and put many people out of work. I also decided to do some research in regards to how dangerous the job actually was and found that it is not listed highly amongst professions with the highest rates of fatality. I thought it could create a good discussion about the business of automating jobs and justifying why a job is worth automating. In this case, it seems like the article is trying to convince us that it would save people from risking their lives to do this dangerous job, but that could just be a cover when you look at the amount of funding this company received. It also brings up an ethical question of whether we should be automating jobs that people are still willing to do.

## Where to send students for good tech news:
I found this to be an interesting question since you ask for websites. However, I personally found this article on the app [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com/), which is also a website but I use it as an app. It is easy to curate content this way and search for articles within a specific subject matter that are related to my own interests. I also use social media in this way. I have made my own [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) feed curated to be mostly about certain topics that I am interested in and this is also a place I often find interesting articles. Since students are very adapted to using social media, this is something I might suggest that they try, even if they are creating a separate account to curate more for content in addition to whichever accounts they have for personal use. I think that apps and websites that allow you to curate the content for yourself tend to be more helpful when looking for specific topics. From there, you can see what websites articles are often being taken from and this can provide you with some additional places to look. The article I found came from [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/). I also often see things from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/) and [Reuters Technology section](https://www.reuters.com/technology/).
